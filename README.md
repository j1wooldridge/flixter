# README

Flixter is an interactive two-sided, video-streaming marketplace platform that features credit card payment capabilities, user role management, complex user interfaces, and advanced database relationships. The goal was to build a app using html, css, javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails to highlight skills aquired during my full stack web developer course.
